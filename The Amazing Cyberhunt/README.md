This is a two and a half hour CTF challenge which is held physically. Since the time span is short and this CTF is aimed at beginners, the questions will be easy.
This writeup will be focusing on the Reverse Engineering category and there are three questions under this category. 
I am glad that I was able to solve all three RE challenges in under 30 minutes. 
<br><br> Enjoy the writeup.
